##FILTER=<ID=s2_blacklist,Description="This filter removes events with breakpoint coordinates matching entries in the blacklist. If an event has no split-reads (but only discordant mates), the precise breakpoint coordinates are unknown. In this case the event is discarded, if the breakpoints are within a range of the insert size around the blacklisted coordinates.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_end_to_end,Description="Theoretically, it should be impossible to observe fusions which only retain the 3' ends of the fusion partners, because the promoter would be missing. In reality, end-to-end fused transcripts are observed, albeit rarely. Most of them are false positives. Therefore, this filter discards such events, unless they have a lot of supporting reads, i.e., split-reads in both fusion partners or split-reads and discordant mates.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_genomic_support,Description="This filter recovers events which were discarded by previous filters due to few supporting reads, but which can be explained by genomic rearrangements as evidenced by structural variant calls obtained from whole-genome sequencing data. Arriba considers structural variant calls to match with breakpoints seen in transcriptomic data, when the breakpoints are less then 100 kb apart and the orientation of the genomic and transcriptomic breakpoints are identical.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_homologs,Description="This filter discards events between genes that have high sequence homology, which frequently leads to erroneous alignments. Homology is quantified by counting the number of shared 16-mers.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_intragenic_exonic,Description="Since exons usually make up only a small fraction of a gene, it is more likely that a genomic rearrangement starts and ends in intronic regions. On the transcriptomic level, this manifests as breakpoints at splice-sites or in introns. Many candidates found by STAR have both breakpoints within exons of the same gene. This is particularly true for intragenic events, which are prone to in vitro artifacts. This filter removes intragenic events, if both breakpoints are in exons and more than 80% of the region between the breakpoints is intronic, such that it should be very unlikely that both breakpoints are located inside exons.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_intronic,Description="This filter discards an event, when none of the supporting reads overlaps an exon (i.e., all alignments are in introns or intergenic regions). True events most often have at least one breakpoint in an exon or at an exon boundary.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_isoforms,Description="This filter searches for additional isoforms for those gene pairs that are predicted to be fused in proper orientation. Typically there is a major isoform which is expressed at a high level and a few low expressed isoforms.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_known_fusions,Description="Events with too few supporting reads but known in cancer.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_many_spliced,Description="Occassionally, a genomic rearrangement produces multiple alternatively spliced transcripts, all of which are low expressed and therefore discarded by the filters relative_support or min_support. This filter recovers events that were discarded due to too few supporting reads, under the circumstances that there are many events between a pair of genes with at least one of the breakpoints at splice-sites. All events between the pair of genes with at least one spliced breakpoint are recovered.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_merge_adjacent,Description="When multiple alternative alignments with equal quality are possible, STAR does not always choose the same one. This leads to multiple breakpoints in close proximity, all of which arise from one and the same event. This filter merges all breakpoints in a window of 5 bp to the breakpoint with the highest number of supporting reads.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_min_support,Description="This filter discards all events with few reads.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_mismappers,Description="Many alignment artifacts are caused by an excessive number of reference mismatches in close proximity due to sequencing errors or adjacent SNPs. STAR tends to clip reads when it encounters a cluster of mismatches. The clipped segment is then used for a chimeric alignment, which occassionally aligns elsewhere in the genome. The filter mismappers performs a sensitive realignment of both segments. If both segments can be aligned to the same gene (while allowing more mismatches than STAR does), the chimeric alignment is considered to be an artifact. When an important proportion of the supporting reads are classified as being aligned incorrectly, the event is discarded.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_no_coverage,Description="For intronic and intragenic breakpoints as well as read-through fusions, this filter checks, if there is some coverage in the vicinity of the breakpoint in the normal alignments. Only reads that are not chimeric are considered. When there are no non-chimeric reads near the breakpoint, this is indicative of an alignment artifact.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_no_genomic_support,Description="This filter removes events with low confidence, if they are not confirmed by structural variant calls obtained from whole-genome sequencing.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_non_coding_neighbors,Description="Genes which are not well studied suffer from incomplete annotation. Many exons are annotated as separate genes even though they might actually be part of one and the same gene. Predicted genes named RP11-... are common examples for this. When poorly understood genes lie next to each other on the same strand, this would frequently lead to false positive predictions of deletions, because the transcripts that span both genes give rise to reads, which resemble focal deletions. This filter discards deletions, which are predicted between two neighboring genes, if both genes are non-coding or one breakpoint is intergenic.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_pcr_fusions,Description="In some tissues certain genes are expressed at very high levels, for example hemoglobin and fibrinogen in blood or collagens in connective tissue. Presumably, the abundance of fragments from such genes increases the chance of unrelated molecules sticking together, which can serve as undesired primers for PCR or may cause the reverse transcriptase enzyme to switch templates. These processes generate a large amount of chimeric fragments in vitro. Such artifactual fusions can be recognized as an extraordinary number of events with breakpoints within exons (rather than at exon boundaries, which is more common for true predictions). This filter eliminates events with genes that are highly expressed (top 0.2%) and have an unbalanced number of split-reads vs. discordant mates or that have an excessive amount of intra-exonic breakpoints.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_relative_support,Description="With increasing expression of a gene the number of chimeric reads mapping to the gene increases, too. Arriba assumes a polynomial relationship between the number of events and the number of supporting reads for a given event. This assumption is based on empirical evidence. An expected value (e-value) is calculated for every event, reflecting how many events with the given number of supporting reads are expected by chance. This filter selects only those events with a low e-value, i.e., that have a high number of supporting reads relative to the overall number of events in a gene. Multiple covariates are taken into account, such as whether a breakpoint is at a splice-site or whether the event is intragenic. The parameters of the polynomial relationship are fixed and were estimated from several hundred RNA-Seq samples of various cancer types.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_select_best,Description="If there are multiple breakpoints detected between the same pair of genes, this filter discards all but the most credible one. Events with split reads in both genes are preferred over events with only discordant mates, because in the latter case, the precise breakpoint is unknown. Moreover, events with a higher number of supporting reads are favored.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_short_anchor,Description="A chimeric read aligns to some part in one of the fused genes and to some part to the other gene. The anchor of a read is the longer aligned segment. It is more likely to be aligned correctly. True positives often have anchors in both fused genes, whereas alignment artifacts are frequently characterized by only a small segment aligning to one of the genes and all anchors to the other.",Source="Arriba">
##FILTER=<ID=s2_spliced,Description="This filter recovers events discarded due to a low number of supporting reads, given that both breakpoints of the event are at splice-sites and there is at least one additional event linking the same pair of genes.",Source="Arriba">
